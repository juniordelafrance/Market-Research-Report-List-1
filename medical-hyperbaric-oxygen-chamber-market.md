<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Hyperbaric Oxygen Chamber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Pressurized</li><li>Oxygen Pressurized</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Medical Hyperbaric Oxygen Chamber market consists of two types: Air Pressurized and Oxygen Pressurized. In an Air Pressurized chamber, the patient breathes in pressurized air while the surrounding air pressure is increased. This helps deliver oxygen to the body's tissues, aiding in wound healing and treating certain medical conditions. On the other hand, an Oxygen Pressurized chamber delivers 100% pure oxygen at higher pressures, ensuring enhanced oxygen absorption. Both types of chambers are designed to provide therapeutic benefits to patients by increasing the oxygen level in their bodies.</p></p>
