<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil-water Separator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity OWS</li><li>Centrifugal OWS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The oil-water separator (OWS) market consists of two main types: gravity OWS and centrifugal OWS. Gravity OWS relies on the difference in density between oil and water to separate the two substances, allowing the oil to rise to the surface for removal. On the other hand, centrifugal OWS uses centrifugal force to separate oil and water, spinning the mixture at high speeds to force the oil particles to the outer edges for collection. Both types are commonly used in various industries to efficiently separate oil from water for disposal or reuse purposes.</p></p>
