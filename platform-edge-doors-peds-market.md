<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Platform Edge Doors (PEDs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full-Closed PEDs</li><li>Semi-Closed PEDs</li><li>Half Height PEDs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Platform Edge Doors (PEDs) are systems designed to enhance safety at train and subway stations by creating a physical barrier between the platform and the tracks. Full-Closed PEDs completely seal the platform, preventing any access to the tracks. Semi-Closed PEDs offer a partial barrier, allowing for some ventilation and accessibility. Half Height PEDs are lower barriers that act as a deterrent but do not completely isolate the platform. These different types of PEDs cater to varying safety requirements, passenger flow management, and infrastructure specifications at different stations.</p></p>
