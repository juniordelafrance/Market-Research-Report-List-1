<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Power Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Steam Stations</li><li>Flash Steam Power Stations</li><li>Binary Cycle Stations</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal power market consists of three main types: dry steam stations, flash steam power stations, and binary cycle stations. In dry steam stations, high-pressure steam is directly extracted from underground reservoirs to drive turbines and generate electricity. Flash steam power stations utilize hot water or brine that is retrieved from geothermal reservoirs and then flashed into steam to generate power. Binary cycle stations involve using moderate-temperature water to heat a secondary fluid, usually an organic compound, which then drives a turbine. These different types cater to varying geothermal resources and enable efficient electricity production.</p></p>
