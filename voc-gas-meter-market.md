<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VOC Gas Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PID</li><li>Metal-oxide Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>VOC gas meters are used to measure volatile organic compounds in different environments. Two commonly used types in the market are PID (photoionization detector) and metal-oxide semiconductor. PID meters work by ionizing gas particles using UV light and measuring the resulting electrical current. They are typically more sensitive and accurate. Metal-oxide semiconductor meters use a semiconductor sensor to detect and measure VOCs. While less expensive than PID meters, they may offer less precision. Both types are widely used in industries such as manufacturing, chemical, and environmental monitoring.</p></p>
