<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Respirator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-purifying Respirators</li><li>Supplied-air Respirators</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Respirators are classified into two main types: Air-purifying Respirators (APRs) and Supplied-air Respirators (SARs). APRs work by filtering out airborne contaminants, such as dust, gases, or chemicals, from the surrounding air before it is inhaled. SARs, on the other hand, provide a clean air supply from an external source, typically through a hose or tube connected to a remote compressed air system. Both types are crucial in industries where workers are exposed to hazardous substances, ensuring their safety by preventing the inhalation of harmful particles.</p></p>
