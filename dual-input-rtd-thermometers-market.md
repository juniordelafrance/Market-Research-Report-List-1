<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dual-Input RTD Thermometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resistive Thermal Detector</li><li>RTD Probes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dual-input RTD thermometers are devices used for measuring temperature and consist of two input channels. These channels can be used to measure temperature using resistive thermal detectors (RTDs). RTDs are sensors that utilize the change in electrical resistance of a metal wire as a function of temperature. RTD probes, on the other hand, are the physical devices that contain the RTD element and are inserted into the medium whose temperature is being measured. Both the resistive thermal detector and RTD probes are commonly used in various industries for accurate temperature measurement.</p></p>
