<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Over-the-horizon Radar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Skywave Over-the-horizon Radar</li><li>Groundwave Over-the-horizon Radar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Over-the-horizon radar (OTH) systems can be categorized into two main types: Skywave Over-the-horizon Radar and Groundwave Over-the-horizon Radar. Skywave OTH radar utilizes the Earth's ionosphere to bounce radio waves off and detect objects over long distances, typically hundreds to thousands of kilometers away. On the other hand, Groundwave OTH radar relies on signals that travel along the Earth's surface, allowing for detection of objects at shorter ranges but with better accuracy. These two types cater to different operational requirements and environments in the radar market.</p></p>
