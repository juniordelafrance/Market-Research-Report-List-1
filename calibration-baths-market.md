<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Calibration Baths Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry-Block</li><li>Liquid</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Calibration baths are used for calibrating temperature sensors and instruments. There are two main types of calibration baths: dry-block and liquid. Dry-block calibration baths use metal blocks to heat or cool the sensors, ensuring accurate temperature readings. They are compact, portable, and ideal for on-site calibration. Liquid calibration baths, on the other hand, use a liquid medium, such as water or oil, to keep the sensors at a constant temperature. They offer better thermal uniformity but are larger and less portable compared to dry-block baths.</p></p>
