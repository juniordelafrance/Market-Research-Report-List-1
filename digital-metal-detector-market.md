<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Metal Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Very Low Frequency</li><li>Pulse Induction</li><li>Beat-frequency Oscillation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital metal detector market can be categorized into three types: Very Low Frequency (VLF), Pulse Induction (PI), and Beat-frequency Oscillation (BFO). VLF detectors operate by transmitting and receiving electromagnetic waves at different frequencies, allowing them to distinguish between various metals. PI detectors use a single coil to create quick pulses of current, which induce magnetic fields in the ground. BFO detectors use two coils, one to transmit a continuous wave and the other to receive any disruptions caused by metallic objects. Each type has its own advantages and limitations in terms of depth range and target identification accuracy.</p></p>
