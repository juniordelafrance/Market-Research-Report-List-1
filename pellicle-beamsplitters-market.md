<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pellicle Beamsplitters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coated Pellicle Beamsplitters</li><li>Uncoated Pellicle Beamsplitters</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Pellicle beamsplitters are optical devices used to split incident light into two beams. Coated pellicle beamsplitters have a thin layer of coating on the pellicle surface, which helps enhance their reflectivity and transmission properties. These beamsplitters are commonly used in applications that require precise control of light intensity. On the other hand, uncoated pellicle beamsplitters do not have any coating on the surface, resulting in a lower reflectivity and transmission efficiency. They are typically used in applications where minimal light intensity changes are acceptable.</p></p>
