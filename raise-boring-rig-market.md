<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Raise Boring Rig Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Raise-boring</li><li>Down-reaming</li><li>Box-holing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Raise boring rig market types can be classified into three categories: raise-boring, down-reaming, and box-holing. Raise-boring entails drilling a pilot hole which is then expanded to a larger diameter using a reaming head. Down-reaming, on the other hand, involves drilling a larger hole from the start. Lastly, box-holing refers to drilling a smaller hole parallel to an existing tunnel or shaft for the purpose of accessing it. These market types cater to different requirements depending on the project's specifications and objectives.</p></p>
