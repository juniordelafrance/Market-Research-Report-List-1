<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Liquid Point Level Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Contactless</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Optical Liquid Point Level Sensor market can be categorized into two types: contact and contactless sensors. Contact sensors operate by physically coming into contact with the liquid to measure its level. These sensors are typically made of materials like conductive or resistive metal that change their electrical properties as they come into contact with the liquid. Contactless sensors, on the other hand, don't require physical contact with the liquid. They use technologies like lasers or ultrasonic waves to detect the liquid level based on reflections or echoes, providing a non-intrusive measurement method.</p></p>
