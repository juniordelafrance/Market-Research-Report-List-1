<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Pallet Wrapping Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-arm</li><li>Double-arm</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automatic pallet wrapping machines come in two main types: single-arm and double-arm. Single-arm machines have a single rotating arm that moves around the stationary pallet to wrap it with stretch film. This type is suitable for smaller operations with limited space, as it requires less room to operate. On the other hand, double-arm machines have two rotating arms that move simultaneously on opposite sides of the pallet, providing quicker wrapping and increased throughput. This type is ideal for larger operations with higher pallet wrapping demands.</p></p>
