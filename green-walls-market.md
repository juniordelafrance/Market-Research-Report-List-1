<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Green Walls Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>

<p><p>Green walls, also known as vertical gardens, have gained popularity in recent years due to their numerous benefits. There are two main market types for green walls: soil-less and soil-based. Soil-less green walls use a hydroponic system, where plants are grown without soil and receive nutrients through a water-based solution. This method is ideal for indoor environments with limited space. On the other hand, soil-based green walls involve cultivating plants in a growing medium, such as soil or compost, allowing for a wider variety of plant species and a more natural setup. Both market types offer opportunities for individuals and businesses to incorporate greenery into their spaces while enjoying the benefits of improved air quality, aesthetic appeal, and potential energy savings.</p></p>
