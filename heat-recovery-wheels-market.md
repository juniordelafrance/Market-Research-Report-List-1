<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Recovery Wheels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condensation Rotors</li><li>Hygroscopic Rotors</li><li>Sorption Rotors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heat recovery wheel market consists of three main types: condensation rotors, hygroscopic rotors, and sorption rotors. Condensation rotors use a heat exchange process that involves the condensation of moisture to recover heat energy. Hygroscopic rotors, on the other hand, use a material that can absorb moisture from the air, which then releases the heat when it is rotated through a heating zone. Lastly, sorption rotors use a combination of adsorption and desorption to recover and release heat. These different types of heat recovery wheels offer various advantages and are utilized in different applications based on specific requirements.</p></p>
