<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Data Center Liquid Immersion Cooling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Phase Cooling</li><li>Two Phase Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Data Center Liquid Immersion Cooling market includes two types: Single Phase Cooling and Two Phase Cooling. In Single Phase Cooling, a liquid coolant is used to absorb heat from data center components without boiling, keeping it in its liquid phase. It then passes through a cooling system to dissipate the heat. In Two Phase Cooling, the liquid coolant is designed to boil, absorbing heat as it evaporates. The vapor then condenses back into a liquid and the process repeats, resulting in efficient heat transfer.</p></p>
