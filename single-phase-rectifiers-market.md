<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single-phase Rectifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Half-wave Rectification</li><li>Full-wave Rectification</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single-phase rectifiers are used to convert alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC) in electronic devices. Half-wave rectification is a type of single-phase rectifier that utilizes only half of the AC input waveform, effectively producing a pulsating DC output. This method is less efficient and suitable for low-power applications. On the other hand, full-wave rectification utilizes both halves of the AC input waveform for a smoother and more continuous DC output. Full-wave rectifiers are more efficient and widely used in high-power applications.</p></p>
