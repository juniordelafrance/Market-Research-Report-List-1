<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Booster Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Stage</li><li>Multiple Stage</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Booster pumps are classified into two market types, single stage and multiple stage pumps. Single stage pumps have only one impeller that increases fluid pressure, making them suitable for low-pressure applications. They are commonly used for residential or small commercial purposes where a moderate increase in pressure is required. Multiple stage pumps have multiple impellers arranged in series, allowing them to provide high-pressure output. These pumps are typically used in industries requiring high-pressure processes such as water treatment plants, irrigation systems, or power generation.</p></p>
