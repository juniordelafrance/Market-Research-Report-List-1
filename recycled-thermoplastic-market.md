<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Recycled Thermoplastic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bio-Degradable</li><li>Non- Biodegradable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The recycled thermoplastic market consists of two main types: bio-degradable and non-biodegradable. Bio-degradable thermoplastics are those that can decompose naturally with the help of microorganisms. These materials are environmentally friendly and reduce waste accumulation. Non-biodegradable thermoplastics, on the other hand, do not break down naturally and remain in the environment for an extended period. Although they can be recycled, they have a higher environmental impact compared to bio-degradable thermoplastics. Both types contribute to the recycled thermoplastic market, with bio-degradable thermoplastics being the more sustainable choice.</p></p>
