<p><h1>Thrombin (Human) Market Analysis Examines its Scope on Growth Opportunities, and Forecasted Trends Spanning from 2024 to 2031.</h1></p><p><strong>Thrombin (Human) Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Thrombin, also known as human thrombin, is a serine protease enzyme involved in blood clotting. It is produced from a precursor protein called prothrombin by the action of an enzyme called thrombin activator. Thrombin plays a crucial role in the formation of fibrin, a fibrous protein that helps in the clotting process, by converting soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin. It also activates other clotting factors, such as factor XIII and platelets, leading to the formation of a stable clot.</p><p>The thrombin (human) market is anticipated to witness significant growth during the forecast period. The market growth can be attributed to several factors, including the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, rising number of surgical procedures, and growing demand for thrombin-based products in wound management. Additionally, the expanding geriatric population, which is more susceptible to blood clotting disorders, is expected to drive the market growth.</p><p>Furthermore, technological advancements in the purification and production of thrombin, along with the development of recombinant thrombin, are likely to create new growth opportunities in the market. The use of recombinant thrombin eliminates the risk of transmitting pathogens from human-derived sources, thus ensuring product safety.</p><p>In terms of trends, there is a growing preference for bovine- and human-derived thrombin products due to their effectiveness and safety. Moreover, the market is witnessing the adoption of innovative delivery methods, such as sprayable thrombin solutions, which aid in the efficient management of bleeding during surgical procedures.</p><p>Overall, the thrombin (human) market is projected to grow at a significant rate of 11.5% during the forecast period. The market's growth can be attributed to factors such as increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, rising number of surgical procedures, and advancements in thrombin purification and production techniques. Moving forward, the market is expected to witness further advancements in thrombin-based products and delivery methods, driving its growth.</p></p>
