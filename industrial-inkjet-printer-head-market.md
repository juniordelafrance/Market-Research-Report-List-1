<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Inkjet Printer Head Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piezoelectric Type</li><li>Thermal Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Industrial Inkjet Printer Head Market Types:</p><p>1. Piezoelectric Type: Piezoelectric inkjet printer heads operate using piezoelectric materials that expand and contract when an electric voltage is applied. This movement generates pressure, forcing ink droplets to be ejected onto the printing surface. This type of printer head offers high printing resolution and versatile ink compatibility, making it suitable for various industrial applications.</p><p>2. Thermal Type: Thermal inkjet printer heads work by heating the ink within tiny chambers, causing it to vaporize and create a bubble. This bubble then bursts, expelling droplets of ink onto the printing medium. It provides high-speed printing capabilities, good color reproduction, and is generally more cost-effective than other printer head types. However, it may have limitations in terms of ink compatibility and durability.</p></p>
