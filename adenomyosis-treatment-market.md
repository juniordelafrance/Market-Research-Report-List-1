These treatments provide an alternative to surgery for women who wish to preserve their fertility and avoid invasive procedures. Moreover, the increasing preference for outpatient procedures and minimally invasive techniques is further propelling market expansion.</p><p>In conclusion, the Adenomyosis Treatment Market is poised for substantial growth, with a projected CAGR of 14% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to factors such as increasing awareness, advancements in diagnostic techniques, and the development of novel treatment options. The market is expected to witness a shift towards non-surgical approaches and minimally invasive procedures, catering to the needs of patients seeking fertility preservation and less invasive treatments.</p></p>
