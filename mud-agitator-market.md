<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mud Agitator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontally Mounted</li><li>Vertically Mounted</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The mud agitator market is categorized into two types based on the installation method: horizontally mounted and vertically mounted. Horizontally mounted mud agitators are designed to be installed on the side of a tank or vessel, providing agitation parallel to the tank floor. This type is commonly used in larger tanks where there is sufficient space. Vertically mounted mud agitators, on the other hand, are installed from the top of the tank and provide agitation perpendicular to the tank floor. This type is particularly suitable for smaller tanks where space is limited.</p></p>
