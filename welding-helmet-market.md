<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Welding Helmet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Welding Helmet</li><li>Auto Darkening Welding Helmets</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The welding helmet market comprises two types: passive welding helmets and auto darkening welding helmets. Passive welding helmets have a fixed dark tint that protects the welder's eyes from harmful UV and infrared radiation at all times. On the other hand, auto darkening welding helmets feature a special lens that automatically darkens when the arc is struck, allowing for better visibility during non-welding tasks. These helmets provide a higher level of convenience and safety compared to passive helmets, as they eliminate the need for frequent lifting and replacing of the helmet.</p></p>
