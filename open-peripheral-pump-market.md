<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Open Peripheral Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Magnetic Peripheral Pump</li><li>Centrifugal Peripheral Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The open peripheral pump market includes two main types of pumps: magnetic peripheral pumps and centrifugal peripheral pumps. Magnetic peripheral pumps use a magnetic field to create a rotating impeller that moves the fluid. These pumps are typically used for applications where a seal is not desired, such as in chemical and industrial processes. Centrifugal peripheral pumps, on the other hand, use centrifugal force to move the fluid, utilizing a rotating impeller and a volute casing. These pumps are commonly used in domestic water systems and irrigation.</p></p>
