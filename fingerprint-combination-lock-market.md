<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fingerprint Combination Lock Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Optical Scanner</li><li>Ultrasound</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The fingerprint combination lock market is divided into two main types: optical scanner and ultrasound. Optical scanners use light to capture the fingerprint image and then compare it with existing data to grant access. Ultrasound scanners, on the other hand, emit sound waves that create a 3D image of the fingerprint, which is then matched with the stored data for authentication. Both technologies provide secure and convenient solutions for accessing secured areas by using the uniqueness of an individual's fingerprint.</p></p>
