<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PCR Reagent and Kit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Built-in Hot Start</li><li>No built-in Hot Start</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) reagents and kits are essential components and tools used in the process of DNA amplification. There are two main types of PCR reagent markets: Built-in Hot Start and No built-in Hot Start. The Built-in Hot Start PCR reagent and kits contain DNA polymerase enzymes that are chemically modified to remain inactive until the reaction is heated. This prevents non-specific amplification, enhancing the specificity and sensitivity of the PCR reaction. In contrast, the No built-in Hot Start PCR reagent and kits lack this modification and require additional steps or reagents to prevent non-specific amplification.</p></p>
