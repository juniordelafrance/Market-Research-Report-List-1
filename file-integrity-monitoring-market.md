<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The File Integrity Monitoring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Agent-based</li><li>Agent-less</li></ul></p>
<p><p>File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) is a technology used to ensure the security and integrity of files within a system. There are two types of FIM markets - agent-based and agent-less. Agent-based FIM requires the installation of software agents on each system to monitor and track file changes, providing detailed information and real-time alerts. On the other hand, agent-less FIM operates without installing any software agents, utilizing existing system logs to monitor files. Both types aim to detect unauthorized file modifications or access, but differ in their approach and implementation.</p></p>
